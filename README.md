# DS_Project
Originally a project for Distributed Systems class at ENS Lyon, you can find the instructions [here](https://shared.hadriencroubois.com/teaching/2016-M1-SystDist/project.pdf)  

Done using OTP principles, still in construction.  

The goal is to create a distributed system able to hold data we send to it. It is assumed we know the address of one node in the topology and with it you can add, retrieve or delete some data.
